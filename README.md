Conway's game of life using HTML, JavaScript, p5.js

Wikipedia: _The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input._

I copied this code from a YouTube video while simultaneously understanding how to build it in the first place.
Currently, it only shows a grid and the game inside it.

**11 February, 2022:** In the next version, I want to add a proper UI using HTML and CSS.

**15 February, 2022** Added proper UI and now it looks beaut **chef's kiss**.
